# Prediction of Car Performance using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the performance of cars using machine learning techniques, with a specific focus on fuel efficiency represented as Miles per Gallon (MPG). By leveraging various machine learning algorithms and analyzing car specifications like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, acceleration, origin, and weight, we can estimate a car's MPG accurately.

Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the project aims to fine-tune the model's performance and optimize its accuracy. By addressing real-world factors that affect car performance, such as driving conditions and road types, the developed machine learning model can provide reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for car manufacturers, dealerships, and consumers in making informed decisions about vehicle selection and design. This project's objective is to contribute to a more sustainable and efficient automotive industry by utilizing the power of machine learning in predicting car performance.
